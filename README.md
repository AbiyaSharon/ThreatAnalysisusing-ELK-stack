# ELK Stack Threat Hunting Project

This project uses the **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) to analyze system logs, detect potential intrusions, and visualize security-related data. The tool integrates with threat intelligence feeds and provides capabilities for detecting known Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), brute-force attacks, and other malicious activities in the system.

## Features

- **Log Analysis**: Ingest and analyze logs using the ELK Stack.
- **Threat Detection**: Detect IoCs and brute-force attacks from logs.
- **Visualizations**: Create Kibana dashboards for interactive exploration of log data and threat activity.
- **Integration with Threat Intelligence**: Use threat intelligence feeds to enrich log data and identify potential threats.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Set up alerts for specific threat activities based on log data.

## Tech Stack

- **Elasticsearch**: For storing, searching, and analyzing large datasets (logs).
- **Logstash**: For processing and ingesting logs into Elasticsearch.
- **Kibana**: For visualizing log data and setting up interactive dashboards.
- **Filebeat**: Lightweight shipper for forwarding logs from the system to Logstash.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Integration with external threat intelligence feeds for enrichment.
- **Yara**: For detecting IoCs.
- **Python**: For backend scripting and analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Docker** (for easy setup of the ELK Stack)
- **Python** (version 3.x)
- **Elasticsearch**, **Kibana**, and **Logstash** (via Docker or local setup)
- **Filebeat** (for log forwarding)

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/elk-threat-hunting.git
cd elk-threat-hunting
Step 2: Set Up the ELK Stack Using Docker
Install Docker on your machine (if not already installed).

Run the ELK Stack in Docker:

In the project directory, you will find a docker-compose.yml file to start the ELK Stack:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
This will start the following services:

Elasticsearch (on port 9200)
Kibana (on port 5601)
Logstash (to process and forward logs to Elasticsearch)
Wait for the containers to start, which might take a few minutes.

Step 3: Set Up Filebeat to Forward Logs
Install Filebeat on your system:

For Linux
For Windows
Configure Filebeat to forward logs to Logstash:

Modify the filebeat.yml configuration file in your Filebeat installation to point to your Logstash container.
Example configuration:

yaml
Copy code
output.logstash:
  hosts: ["localhost:5044"]
Start Filebeat to begin forwarding logs to Logstash:

bash
Copy code
sudo service filebeat start
Step 4: Kibana Dashboards
Open Kibana in your browser:

bash
Copy code
http://localhost:5601
Create an index pattern in Kibana to visualize logs stored in Elasticsearch.

Use pre-defined or custom dashboards to visualize the log data and detect potential threats.

# Step 5: Threat Intelligence Integration (Optional)
You can integrate external threat intelligence feeds to enrich log data and identify potential threats. Some sources you can use include:

AlienVault OTX
Abuse.ch
OpenPhish
These feeds can be ingested into the ELK Stack using Logstash.

Step 6: Detection Rules
Create and configure detection rules to monitor specific types of threats such as brute-force attacks, unusual network traffic, or signs of compromise. These rules can be defined using queries in Elasticsearch or by using Kibana's detection engine.

Usage
Once the ELK Stack and Filebeat are set up, you can interact with the tool through Kibana:

Dashboard: View real-time visualizations and graphs of your logs.
Search: Use Kibana's search functionality to filter logs for specific indicators, such as failed login attempts or unusual network traffic.
Alerts: Set up alerts based on predefined queries or thresholds, such as when a certain number of failed login attempts are detected.
Threat Intelligence: Enrich your logs with external threat intelligence data to detect known indicators of compromise (IoCs).
